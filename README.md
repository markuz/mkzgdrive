# mkzgdrive

A small python script to upload to Google Drive all that you have in a directory.

Please note that you need to get the CLIENT SECRET key, go to https://console.developers.google.com/ create a project, then go to **APIs &amp; Auth** &gt; **Credentials** and create a new client id.

You should end with three things:

*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">Client ID</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">Client Secret</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 28px;">Redirect URIs.</span><div>
</div>
